# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Docker, Docker Compose, and GitHub Actions implementation for the GPU-RSFK project.

## Files Created

### 1. Docker Configuration

#### `Dockerfile`
- Base image: `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04`
- Installs Python 3, build tools, and dependencies
- Builds the CUDA library using `make python_archall` (supports compute_30, compute_61, compute_75)
- Installs the Python package
- Includes common dependencies for running examples (numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, tqdm, scipy)

#### `docker-compose.yml`
- Defines two services:
  - `gpu-rsfk`: Interactive container for development and testing
  - `experiments`: Pre-configured to run example experiments
- Configures GPU support via NVIDIA Docker runtime
- Mounts three volumes:
  - `./examples` → `/workspace/examples` (example scripts)
  - `./datasets` → `/workspace/datasets` (dataset files)
  - `./results` → `/workspace/results` (output files)

#### `.dockerignore`
- Optimizes Docker builds by excluding unnecessary files
- Excludes git files, IDE configs, build artifacts, and large datasets

#### `DOCKER.md`
- Comprehensive documentation for Docker usage
- Installation instructions for NVIDIA Docker runtime
- Usage examples for both Docker Compose and direct Docker commands
- Troubleshooting guide
- Instructions for building with specific CUDA architectures

### 2. Python Packaging

#### `python/setup.py`
- Simplified to use pyproject.toml for configuration
- Compatible with both legacy and modern build systems

#### `python/pyproject.toml`
- Modern Python packaging configuration (PEP 517/518/621)
- Package metadata including version, description, authors
- Dependencies specification
- Classifiers for PyPI
- Project URLs (homepage, bug tracker, source code)

#### `python/MANIFEST.in`
- Ensures README, LICENSE, and .so files are included in distributions

#### `requirements.txt`
- Lists dependencies for running examples
- Includes core dependencies (numpy, scikit-learn, scipy)
- Documents optional dependencies (faiss-gpu, annoy, tsnecuda)

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### `.github/workflows/publish-to-pypi.yml`
- **Triggers:**
  - Automatically on new releases (published)
  - Manually via workflow dispatch
- **Jobs:**
  1. **build**: Builds source distribution and validates with twine
  2. **publish-to-pypi**: Publishes to PyPI (on releases or manual trigger with 'yes')
  3. **publish-to-test-pypi**: Publishes to TestPyPI (on manual trigger for testing)
- Uses trusted publishing (no API tokens required when properly configured)
- Includes artifact upload/download for build artifacts

#### `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`
- Tests Docker builds on pushes and pull requests
- Uses Docker Buildx for efficient builds
- Validates docker-compose.yml configuration
- Implements GitHub Actions caching for faster builds

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### `README.md`
- Added Docker installation section with references to DOCKER.md
- Includes quick start examples for Docker Compose usage

#### `.gitignore`
- Added entries for Docker-related artifacts (`results/`)
- Added entries for Python packaging artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`)

## Usage Instructions

### Building with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Run interactively
docker-compose run --rm gpu-rsfk

# Run a specific example
docker-compose run --rm gpu-rsfk python3 examples/create_knn_graph.py
```

### Publishing to PyPI

1. **For testing (manual):**
   - Go to Actions → "Build and Publish to PyPI" → Run workflow
   - Select "no" for publish (publishes to TestPyPI only)

2. **For release (automatic):**
   - Create a new release on GitHub
   - Tag it with version (e.g., v0.0.1)
   - Workflow automatically builds and publishes to PyPI

3. **Setup Required:**
   - Configure PyPI trusted publishing:
     - Go to PyPI → Account → Publishing
     - Add GitHub publisher (owner: BrunoMeyer, repo: gpu-rsfk, workflow: publish-to-pypi.yml)

### Local Package Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
make python_archall
cd python && pip install -e .

# Build source distribution
cd python && python -m build --sdist
```

## Architecture Support

The Dockerfile builds for multiple CUDA compute capabilities:
- compute_30 (Kepler)
- compute_61 (Pascal)
- compute_75 (Turing)

To build for a specific architecture, modify the Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# For RTX 3090 (compute_86)
RUN make python_arch86

# For RTX 2080 (compute_75)
RUN make python_arch75
```

## Notes

- The source distribution does NOT include the compiled .so file (users need CUDA to build)
- For PyPI distribution, consider creating pre-built wheels for common platforms
- GPU support in Docker requires nvidia-docker2 runtime installed on host
- The package version is currently 0.0.1 - update in `python/pyproject.toml` for releases
